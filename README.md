## 3. Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning - [Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)]
- Unsupervised Learning - [K-Means Clustering, PCA (Principal Component Analysis)]
- Reinforcement Learning

## 4. Most Used Types of Data
1. **Quantitative Data**
   - Discrete: Counts (e.g., number of items).
   - Continuous: Measurements (e.g., income, temperature).
2. **Categorical Data**
   - Nominal: Categories without order (e.g., colors, gender).
   - Ordinal: Ranked categories (e.g., education levels).
3. **Time-Series Data**
   - Sequential data over time (e.g., stock prices).
4. **Structured Data**
   - Tabular format (e.g., databases, spreadsheets).

## 5. Most Used Types of Analysis
1. **Descriptive Analysis**
   - Summarizes data (mean, median, charts).
2. **Predictive Analysis**
   - Forecasts future trends (regression, machine learning).
3. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Identifies patterns and insights (visualizations, clustering).

## 6. ML Workflow
- Problem Definition
- Data Collection
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Building
- Evaluation and Deployment

## 7. Steps in Data Preprocessing
- Handling Missing Data
- Data Cleaning
- Encoding Categorical Variables
- Feature Scaling (Normalization, Standardization)

## 8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Basics
1. Understand the Dataset
   - Check structure, data types, and size.
2. Summary Statistics
   - Mean, median, min, max, standard deviation.
3. Visualizations
   - Histograms, bar charts, scatter plots.
4. Missing Value Handling
   - Remove or fill with mean/median/mode.
5. Outlier Detection
   - Box plots or IQR method.

## 9. Feature Engineering - Basics
1. Handle Missing Data
   - Fill with mean, median, or mode.
2. Scale Numerical Data
   - Normalize (Min-Max) or Standardize (Z-score).
3. Create New Features
   - Extract from dates or combine existing features.


## 10. Overfitting & Underfitting 

## 11. Evalution Matrics  
1. Classification Metrics:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
2. Regression Metrics:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.
3. Clustering Metrics:
   - Silhouette Score, Inertia.


# Deep Learning (DL)

## What is Deep Learning?
- A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to learn from large amounts of data.

## Key Concepts:
- **Neural Networks (NN)**: Networks of nodes (neurons) that process data.
- **Activation Functions**: Functions (like ReLU) that help decide if a neuron should activate.
- **Training**: Adjusting weights to minimize errors using backpropagation and gradient descent.

## Applications:
- Image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, self-driving cars.

# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## What is NLP?
- A field of AI that enables machines to understand and process human language.

## Key Concepts:
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into smaller units (words, sentences).
- **Vectorization**: Converting text into numbers for machine understanding.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Identifying if text is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Applications:
- Chatbots, text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation.

# Computer Vision (CV)

## What is Computer Vision?
- A field of AI that enables machines to interpret and analyze visual information from images or videos.

## Key Concepts:
- **Image Classification**: Assigning a label to an image (e.g., cat or dog).
- **Object Detection**: Identifying objects within an image.
- **Image Segmentation**: Dividing an image into parts (e.g., foreground and background).

## Applications:
- Facial recognition, self-driving cars, medical image analysis.
